# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple interest calculator program that calculates the simple interest given the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Usage

To use this calculator, follow these steps:

1. Input the principal amount (`p`).
2. Input the time period in years (`t`).
3. Input the annual rate of interest (`r`).
4. The program will output the simple interest calculated using the formula `simple interest = p * t * r`.

## Example

Input:
- Principal amount (`p`) = 1000
- Time period in years (`t`) = 2
- Annual rate of interest (`r`) = 0.05

Output:
- Simple interest = 1000 * 2 * 0.05 = 100
